# A simple LaTeX Showcase

All the relevant information is in [`showcase.tex`](./showcase.tex). You can clone the repository, download it as a zip file or just copy-paste the relevant code into your own documents.

NOTE: The document will not compile if you don't have the `meme.png` and `refs.bib` files in the same folder (you can comment out the relevant code if you don't need them).
